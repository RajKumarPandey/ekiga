Developers:
- Please keep the current coding style in Ekiga and put comments.
  Functions descriptions should have 3 fields: DESCRIPTION, BEHAVIOR
  and PRE.  PRE means the set of conditions on the parameters to be
  sure that the function works.  See src/main.h for an example.
- Any new file you create must start with the license preamble and the
  short file description, see src/main.cpp for an example.
- Options: Ekiga follows the "Instant Apply" model.
- The way to include things is the following: include the Ekiga
  headers before the others.  All the .h files should contain #include
  "common.h" as first include because it will itself include a ptlib
  file containing compilation flags required to have a well-working
  Ekiga.  The .h corresponding to the .cpp file must be included
  before the other includes.  Libraries headers includes must follow
  the application headers includes.  ../config.h must be included
  before the rest in all .cpp files.
- Doxygen: We suggest the JavaDoc style.  It takes a "!" as designator
  after a normal C/C++ comment begin.  This is followed by specific
  keywords.  See the code for examples, such as
  lib/engine/videoinput/videinput-manager.h.
- Encoding: Ekiga is completely UTF-8.  The only exception is that the
  (audio/video) device names are in system codepage for Windows.  The
  latin2utf and utf2latin functions take care of that.
