See our wiki: http://wiki.ekiga.org/index.php/ToDo
- clean up signal relay. No need to have a class method for each signal "relay".
- Update DOC with 5.0 screenshots
- Make sure refresh also works as expected.
- Turn LiveObject into an Actor or drop it?
- add_heap does not seem to be used anymore
- GSettings migration ? To check.
- Roster migration : to implement + implement adding Echo test and such to the roster when it is not empty.
- trackable object (in .h ?)
- Is Heap-Impl still used in the OPAL component ?
- This existing_group function passed to the Opal::Account ctor is so weiiiiiird....
- Proof check all dialogs. e.g. can we delete the SIP URI of a roster contact and save it ?
- Check Forms for mnemonics & regexes.
- Check Accels
- Prefs should perhaps use GtkInfoBar to prevent entering wrong forward uris.
- Call Window : add / remove entries -> concert to add + disable actions
- Contact phone numbers: open a popup with all possibilities instead of right-click popup => 1 action. Urgent.
- Cleanup Ekiga App. Not sure everything is initialized at the right place.
- Cleanup files (e.g. codecsbox which is frontend, not core)
- Roster should be refreshed when accounts are added/removed
- Main menu should be refreshed when account is disabled/enabled
- Global actions should be updated if an Ekiga.net/DiamondCard is added/removed.
- Call Window: on_setup_call, check if it is the right place for blacklist handling + status change ("calling", isn't it called on incoming calls too ?)
- Send user input capabilities
- Check we do not need to add more capabilities for VP8 / VP8-OM like wiht H.264 High Profile
- Add back "Add to roster" Actions
- Add -Wl,-z,defs -Wl,--as-needed as link flags and fix subsequent link error with ekiga_dbus_component_new not found
- Check video-bitrate vs video-tx-bitrate usage.
- warn if required codecs are not present.
- Use STL/RefLister instead of inheriting from them.
- Add support for click-to-dial when there are several numbers to dial
- OPAL should retry SUBSCRIBE on Not retrying SUBSCRIBE due to error response 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist
- OPAL should do automatic reREGISTER and presence reSUBSCRIBE/PUBLISH still works when a registrar is down then comes online.
- Probably it would be wise to use inheritance for Accounts
- Check whether we make Pulse or ALSA as audio device by default
- The ServiceCore should be part of a high-level class of the engine (Service ?)
