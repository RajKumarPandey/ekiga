- Check what happens when we hide the window. Can we get it back when we want ?
- Update DOC with 4.0 screenshots
- Make sure that automatic reREGISTER and presence reSUBSCRIBE/PUBLISH still works when a registrar is down then comes online.
- Make sure refresh also works as expected.

- Remove PresentityDecorator && ContactDecorator
- Simplify Call Core code by using signal relay (boost::ref)
- Remove ProxyPresentity ?
- Turn LiveObject into an Actor ?
- add_heap does not seem to be used anymore
- questions from Account Edition relayed to PresenceCore ? Well why not.
- GSettings migration ? To check.
- Roster migration : to implement + implement adding Echo test and such to the roster when it is not empty.
- trackable object (in .h ?)
- Is Heap-Impl still used in the OPAL component ?
- This existing_group function passed to the Opal::Account ctor is so weiiiiiird....
- Proof check all dialogs. e.g. can we delete the SIP URI of a roster contact and save it ?
- Forms error checking should be simplified. Perhaps with "allow_empty" properties ? and URI handling ?
